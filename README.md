Silky Widgets
=============

## 1. Introduction

Silky Widgets is an array of website styling that applies directly into HTML controls like ``<button>``, ``<input>``, etc.
We make sure that it pairs well with [FatCow's web icons](https://www.fatcow.com/free-icons).

## 2. Usage

To use this styling, just copy the ``silky-widgets.css`` file, located at ``_silky-assets/css``. You can also copy the entire ``_silky-assets`` as well, which includes what's in section 3 of this document. The index.htm contains almost all stylable widgets.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To embed the styling, add:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/the/silky-widgets.css">
```
For advanced widgets, add the script as well:
```
<script src="path/to/the/silky-widgets.js" defer async></script>
```
