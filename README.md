Silky Widgets
=============

1. Introduction
---------------

Silky Widgets is an array of website styling that applies directly into HTML controls like ``<button>``, ``<input>``, etc.
We make sure that it pairs well with [FatCow's web icons](https://www.fatcow.com/free-icons).

2. Usage
--------

To use this styling, just copy the ``silky-widgets.css`` file, located at ``_silky-assets/css``. You can also copy the entire ``_silky-assets`` as well, which includes what's in section 3 of this document. The index.htm contains almost all stylable widgets.

3. What's Included

Silky Widgets includes:

1. [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) and [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?query=roboto) by Christian Robertson.
